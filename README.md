To run the BabyAI-Text code files (curriculum_babyai.py and eval_babyai.py), you will need our modified version of the BabyAI-Text package. 
You should download BabyAI-Text as instructed in the official repo: https://github.com/flowersteam/Grounding_LLMs_with_online_RL

Then, you must simply navigate to the following file: Grounding_LLMs_with_online_RL/babyai-text/babyai_text/levels/mixed_seq_levels.py
and replace it's contents with those found in our repo's mixed_seq_levels.py.
